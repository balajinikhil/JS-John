/* DOM => Document Object Model
When browsers loads a html page it interpret's the data and decides heading, para etc
and stores it as a structure of objects called as  DOM 

Each text element becomes object and can be used to change it dynamically
graphical representation of DOM i.e google*/

/*
Similar to CSS
We must select an element or group of elements which we want to change
Decide the effect we want to apply to the selection

Assign to variable 
We can assign the selected value to variable then use it to call methods
let btn = document.selectElementById('btn')
btn.style.color = blue;

Global Window
*/
let win = window;
console.log(win);
/*
We can see document object in global window which contains all the properties 
we need to change the page dynamically */
